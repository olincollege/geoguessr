# Welcome to Geoguessr Lite! 
 
Welcome to Geoguessr Lite! You will be dropped into a random location in the world and must deduce where you are based on unique observations like key landmarks, license plates, native grass species, road widths, sun positions, and basically anything else that you can possibly think of. 

With this addicting competitive game, we aim to provide an educational platform for users on the different cultures and countries that exist around the world. By visiting all 7 continents online with the touch of a button, we hope to inspire curious users to pursue an adventure to a new place in real life.

* 10k Google Street View images across all 7 continents
* A point system based on gaussian distributions
* Latitude and longitude conversions with haversine functions

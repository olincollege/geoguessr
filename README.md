#  üåè Geoguessr üåè

This is a python-based remake of Geoguessr aimed at educating users on geography in an immersing way. Learn more about different countries and cultures, and take inspiration for your real-life travels!

## Overview

This game recreates the Geoguessr experience with:
* 10k Google Street View images across all 7 continents
* A point system based on gaussian distributions
* Latitude and longitude conversions with haversine functions
* An interactive world map


## Set-Up

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    git@github.com:olincollege/geoguessr.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```
    cd geoguessr/
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

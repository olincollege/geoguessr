# üåè Geoguessr üåè

This is a python-based remake of Geoguessr aimed at educating users on geography in an immersing way. Learn more about different countries and cultures and take inspiration for your real-life travels!

## Overview

This game recreates the Geoguessr experience with:
* 10k Google Street View images across all 7 continents
* A point system based on gaussian distributions
* Latitude and longitude conversions with haversine functions
* A visualization of your guess and answer on a world map


## Set-Up

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:olincollege/geoguessr.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```
    cd geoguessr/
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the Kaggle dataset from the link `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulchambaz/google-street-view?resource=download`. Extract the zip file, move the `dataset` folder into the root of this repository, then run:

    ```
    mkdir -p dataset/images && mv dataset/*.png dataset/images/
    ```    

## Let's Play
Run the game with ```main.py```.
